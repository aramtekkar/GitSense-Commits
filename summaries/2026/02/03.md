# Activity Summary for 2/3/2026

## 4:10:11 AM
The provided log details several code changes, all occurring on **February 2, 2026**, within a short time frame, indicating a focused development effort. The changes involve updates to an existing "Smart Paste" feature and the introduction of new reusable UI components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 2:53:29 PM**
        *   This entry describes the initial implementation of `SmartPasteModal`, a React Native component designed to help users paste and parse bank details from the clipboard.
        *   It utilizes `BottomSheetModal` for its UI, `expo-clipboard` for paste functionality, and `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback.
        *   The modal features distinct states for initial input and "processing" bank details, displaying guidance, an input area, and an activity indicator during processing.
        *   It handles clipboard paste, parses bank details using `parseBankDetails`, and applies them via an `onApply` callback. Error handling and logging are included.
        *   Styling is managed using `react-native-unistyles` and theme-based properties.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:35:51 PM**
        *   A key refinement was made to the `handleClose` function. Previously, it only reset the `isProcessing` state and closed the modal.
        *   The updated version now explicitly clears any pending `processingTimeoutRef` to prevent potential memory leaks or unintended processing after the modal is closed.
        *   Additionally, it clears the `pastedDetails` state upon closing, ensuring the modal is reset for subsequent uses.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ui/ActionCard.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:38:17 PM**
        *   This entry introduces a new, highly reusable `ActionCard` UI component.
        *   It's designed to consistently display actionable items throughout the application, supporting various content types such as titles, descriptions, icons, and footers.
        *   The component offers flexibility with `variant` props (`filled`, `transparent`, `inline`), allowing different visual styles.
        *   It automatically determines whether to show a chevron icon based on the presence of an `onPress` handler, which also determines if the card is interactive (`Pressable`) or static (`Box`).
        *   Extensive customization is possible for icons (size, container, background color), titles (plain text or custom `titleElement`), and accessibility.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteSection.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:39:45 PM**
        *   This entry introduces the `SmartPasteSection` component, which acts as a wrapper or entry point for the smart paste functionality within the "Send Money" flow.
        *   It conditionally renders different UI elements based on state:
            *   If `showAlertBanner` is `false`, it displays an `ActionCard` (aliased as `SmartPasteWidget`) with an "inline" variant, prompting the user to "Paste bank details."
            *   If `showAlertBanner` is `true`, it then checks `isSuccessBanner`:
                *   If `true`, it shows a success `InlineAlertBanner` (aliased as `SmartPasteBanner`) with an `InfoSolidIcon`.
                *   If `false`, it shows a failure `InlineAlertBanner` with a `WarningTriangleIcon` and a call-to-action button to retry pasting.
        *   This component effectively integrates the `SmartPasteModal`'s functionality with appropriate user feedback banners.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Smart Paste Feature Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around the "Smart Paste" functionality for bank details, including its modal interface and its integration points within the application's UI.
*   **UI Component Development:** There's a clear pattern of developing robust, reusable UI components (`ActionCard`) and utilizing them (`SmartPasteSection` uses `ActionCard`). This suggests a move towards a more modular and consistent design system.
*   **Internationalization and Theming:** Both `SmartPasteModal` and `SmartPasteSection` extensively use `t()` from `useTranslation()` for all textual content, and `useTheme()` for styling, indicating strong adherence to localization and a unified theme.
*   **Accessibility:** Components consistently include `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` props, highlighting a focus on screen reader compatibility.
*   **Haptic Feedback and Logging:** `SmartPasteModal` incorporates `expo-haptics` for user experience and `logger` for internal diagnostics, common practices for mobile development quality.

The log details recent development work on a "smart paste" feature for bank details and introduces a new reusable UI component.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Entry (2/2/2026, 2:53:29 PM):** This entry introduces the `SmartPasteModal` component. It is a `BottomSheetModal` designed to help users paste and parse bank details from their clipboard. The component includes:
        *   Integration with `expo-clipboard` for pasting and `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback.
        *   State management for pasted text (`pastedDetails`) and a processing state (`isProcessing`).
        *   A `PROCESSING_DELAY` and a timeout reference (`processingTimeoutRef`) for simulating processing.
        *   `handlePaste` function to get text from the clipboard and `handleContinue` to parse the details using a `parseBankDetails` utility and apply them via `onApply` prop.
        *   Two distinct UI states: a "processing" view with an `ActivityIndicator` and a main view with instructional text, bullet points about required information, a disabled `TextInput` displaying the pasted content, and "Paste" or "Clear" buttons.
        *   Error handling with haptics and logging for clipboard access or parsing failures.
    *   **Subsequent Update (2/2/2026, 3:35:51 PM):** A minor but important refinement was made to the `handleClose` function. It now explicitly clears any active `processingTimeoutRef` and resets the `pastedDetails` state to an empty string when the modal is closed. This ensures a clean state upon dismissal, preventing potential memory leaks or stale data.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ui/ActionCard.tsx` (2/2/2026, 3:38:17 PM):** This entry introduces a new highly reusable `ActionCard` component. It serves as a consistent UI element for action items across the application. Key features include:
    *   Support for multiple visual `variant`s: 'filled', 'transparent', and 'inline'.
    *   Configurable properties for an `icon`, including its size, whether to show an icon container, and its background color.
    *   A `title` and optional `description`, with the ability to provide a custom `titleElement` for more complex inline content.
    *   A `footer` slot for additional content, like a `Badge`.
    *   `onPress` callback for interactive cards, which also dictates whether a `ChevronRightIcon` is shown by default.
    *   Accessibility props (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`).
    *   `disabled` state and `textDecorationLine` for the title.
    *   It renders as a `Pressable` when `onPress` is provided, otherwise as a static `Box`.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteSection.tsx` (2/2/2026, 3:39:45 PM):** This entry defines the `SmartPasteSection` component, which acts as a conditional renderer for the "smart paste" feature's entry point and feedback.
    *   It utilizes the newly introduced `ActionCard` (aliased as `SmartPasteWidget`) to display the entry point for the smart paste functionality. This `ActionCard` is configured as `variant="inline"`, `textDecorationLine="underline"`, and `showChevron={true}`.
    *   It also uses an `InlineAlertBanner` (aliased as `SmartPasteBanner`) to display success or failure messages after bank details parsing. These banners include titles, descriptions, close actions, and appropriate icons (`InfoSolidIcon` for success, `WarningTriangleIcon` for failure), with the failure banner also offering a retry action.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Localization:** All user-facing text strings are localized using the `useTranslation` hook and `t()` function, indicating a strong focus on internationalization.
*   **Theming and Styling:** The application consistently uses `useTheme` and `react-native-unistyles` for managing styles, ensuring a cohesive look and feel across components. Styles reference `theme.colors`, `theme.spacing`, `theme.borderRadii`, and `theme.fonts`.
*   **Reusable UI Components:** There's a clear pattern of creating and consuming reusable UI components from a `@/components/ui` directory (e.g., `Box`, `Button`, `Text`, `Pressable`, `BottomSheetModal`, `BackButton`, `CloseIcon`, and the newly created `ActionCard`). This promotes consistency and reduces code duplication.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** `expo-haptics` is consistently used for providing tactile feedback on user interactions and status changes (e.g., on paste, parsing success/failure).
*   **Accessibility:** Components incorporate accessibility attributes like `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` to enhance usability for screen readers.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error and warning logging (`logger.error`, `logger.warn`) is in place for operations like clipboard access and data parsing, alongside user-facing notification haptics.
*   **Future Dating:** All timestamps are dated "2/2/2026", suggesting placeholder or future-dated entries.
