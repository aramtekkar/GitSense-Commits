# Activity Summary for 2/12/2026

## 12:58:21 PM
The `_layout.tsx` file in `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/app` serves as the root layout for a React Native application, orchestrating global setup, routing, and critical services.

**File: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/app/_layout.tsx`**

*   **Initial State (2/12/2026, 11:01:16 AM):**
    *   The file imports and initializes several core services early, including Intl polyfills, i18n, dev overlay suppression, analytics, API providers, Branch.io, Intercom, and a WebSocketProvider.
    *   It sets up the application's main structure using `expo-router`'s `Stack` navigator, defining public routes (`index`, `invite/[code]`, `biometrics`) and protected routes based on user authentication status and device security (for `onboarding`, `auth`, `(tabs)`, `(app)`).
    *   A `ForceUpgradeModal` is implemented to check the app's current version against a minimum supported version fetched from mobile configuration, prompting an upgrade if necessary.
    *   The `RootLayout` component integrates TanStack Query for data fetching, monitors network status, handles device security checks, and synchronizes Intercom user attributes.
    *   It configures a logger, initializes Intercom and Branch.io after splash screen dismissal, and renders a `NoInternetConnection` component if the device is offline.
    *   Authenticated users are prevented from seeing the main app content until device security checks are complete.
*   **Subsequent Change (2/12/2026, 11:06:39 AM):**
    *   A significant change was made within the `RootLayout` component's conditional rendering logic for the `NoInternetConnection` screen. The condition `if (isOffline)` was modified to `if (true)`. This change hardcodes the `NoInternetConnection` screen to always be visible at this point, overriding the actual network status check.

**File: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/NoInternetConnection/ErrorScreenLayout.tsx`**

*   **Initial State (2/12/2026, 11:36:19 AM):**
    *   This file defines a reusable `ErrorScreenLayout` component, designed for displaying full-screen error messages (e.g., server errors, maintenance, no internet).
    *   It provides a structured layout comprising an icon, title, description, optional downtime information, and a primary action button.
    *   The component supports accessibility features for its elements and incorporates `useSafeAreaInsets` for proper display across different devices, with an option to disable safe area padding for inline usage.
    *   Styling is managed using `react-native-unistyles`, ensuring a consistent look with the application's theme.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Timestamp:** All recorded changes occurred on the same day, `2/12/2026`, indicating a focused development session.
*   **Application Setup and Services:** The `_layout.tsx` file demonstrates a comprehensive approach to application initialization, integrating numerous services like internationalization, analytics, API communication, and third-party SDKs (Branch.io, Intercom).
*   **Security and Authentication:** A strong emphasis on user security is evident through the implementation of device security guards and biometric authentication checks before granting access to protected routes.
*   **Error and Network Handling:** Dedicated components like `NoInternetConnection` and `ForceUpgradeModal`, alongside network status monitoring, highlight a focus on robust error handling and user feedback regarding connectivity and app updates.
*   **Modern React Native Stack:** The use of `expo-router`, `BottomSheetModalProvider`, `GestureHandlerRootView`, `react-native-unistyles`, and TanStack Query points to a modern and comprehensive React Native development stack.
*   **Logging and Debugging:** The explicit configuration and use of a `logger` utility for both informational and error messages across different platforms (`Platform.OS`, `Platform.Version`) indicate a structured approach to monitoring and debugging the application.

## 7:45:35 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ErrorScreens/ErrorScreenLayout.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`ErrorScreenLayout.tsx`**: This file defines a React component for displaying various error screens (e.g., Server Error, Maintenance, No Internet). It includes props for an icon, title, description, optional downtime information, and a button. The component uses `react-native-unistyles` for styling.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/12/2026, 6:50:18 PM**: The initial hardcoded `width: 345` in the `title`, `description`, and `downtime` styles was refactored. A new constant `CONTENT_WIDTH = 345;` was introduced within the `StyleSheet.create` call, and these styles were updated to use `CONTENT_WIDTH`.
*   **2/12/2026, 6:50:42 PM**: The `CONTENT_WIDTH` constant was moved from inside the `StyleSheet.create` function to the global scope of the file, alongside `ICON_SIZE`, improving its scope and readability.
*   **2/12/2026, 6:51:08 PM**: The `title` and `description` styles were modified to include `maxWidth: CONTENT_WIDTH`, in addition to `width: CONTENT_WIDTH`.
*   **2/12/2026, 6:51:24 PM**: The `maxWidth: CONTENT_WIDTH` property that was added to the `title` and `description` styles in the previous change was removed, reverting these styles to only use `width: CONTENT_WIDTH`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All changes are focused on stylistic refactoring within the `ErrorScreenLayout.tsx` file, specifically related to defining a consistent content width.
*   The evolution of the `CONTENT_WIDTH` constant shows a pattern of extracting "magic numbers" into named constants for better maintainability and then refining the constant's placement (from local to file-level scope).
*   There was a brief attempt and subsequent reversal of adding `maxWidth` alongside `width` for the title and description, indicating an iterative process of refining layout constraints.
*   The core functionality and visual structure of the `ErrorScreenLayout` component remained consistent throughout all logged changes; only its internal styling implementation details were modified.
