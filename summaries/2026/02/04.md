# Activity Summary for 2/4/2026

## 12:30:33 AM
The changes log details updates across several UI components and a specific feature within a `nova-cp-app` project, all occurring on **February 2, 2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 2:53:29 PM:** This initial version introduces the `SmartPasteModal` component. It utilizes a `BottomSheetModal` to provide a guided experience for users to paste bank details. Key functionalities include:
        *   Pasting text from the clipboard using `expo-clipboard` with haptic feedback.
        *   Displaying a processing state with an `ActivityIndicator` after initiation.
        *   Parsing pasted details using a `parseBankDetails` utility.
        *   Handling success or failure of parsing with haptic notifications and logging.
        *   A `processingTimeoutRef` is used to manage a delay before attempting to parse details.
        *   The UI includes a disabled `TextInput` to show the pasted content, a "Paste" button, and a "Continue" button.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:35:51 PM:** A significant enhancement was made to the `handleClose` function. It now explicitly clears any pending `processingTimeoutRef` and resets the `pastedDetails` state. This ensures proper cleanup when the modal is dismissed, preventing potential memory leaks or unexpected behavior from delayed processing.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ui/ActionCard.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:38:17 PM:** This entry details the definition of a highly reusable `ActionCard` component. It's designed to provide consistent styling for interactive or informational list items. Key features include:
        *   Support for `title`, `description`, `icon`, and an optional `footer` (e.g., for badges).
        *   Multiple visual `variant` options: `filled`, `transparent`, and a new `inline` variant specifically for rendering a title and chevron in a compact row.
        *   Configurable `iconSize`, `iconBackgroundColor`, and an option to hide the icon container.
        *   A `titleElement` prop allows for custom JSX in the title area, enabling inline icons or other formatting.
        *   The `showChevron` prop can be explicitly set or defaults to `true` if an `onPress` handler is provided, making the card interactive.
        *   New `textDecorationLine` prop for title text styling, enabling underlining.
        *   It integrates accessibility props (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`) and supports a `disabled` state. The component intelligently renders as a `Pressable` when interactive, otherwise as a plain `Box`.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteSection.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:39:45 PM:** This file defines the `SmartPasteSection` component, which acts as a dynamic entry point and feedback mechanism for the smart paste feature. It conditionally renders:
        *   A `SmartPasteWidget` (an `ActionCard` of `inline` variant with an underline) if no alert banner is active, serving as the main button to open the `SmartPasteModal`.
        *   A `SmartPasteBanner` (an `InlineAlertBanner`) to display either success or failure messages after bank details parsing. The failure banner includes an action button to retry.
        *   It uses `InfoSolidIcon` for success and `WarningTriangleIcon` for failure states.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Development Date:** All reported changes occurred on the same day, `2/2/2026`, indicating a focused development effort.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The project heavily relies on a modular, component-based structure, using generic UI components (e.g., `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `ActionCard`) from a shared `components/ui` library.
*   **Theming and Localization:** The `useTheme` and `useTranslation` hooks are consistently applied across all components, highlighting a standardized approach to styling and supporting multiple languages.
*   **User Experience and Accessibility:** Emphasis on user feedback through `expo-haptics` (light, medium, error notifications) and extensive use of `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` props in interactive elements demonstrates a commitment to a good user experience and accessibility.
*   **Logging:** The `logger` utility from `@/utils` is used for debugging and error reporting in various scenarios.
*   **Smart Paste Feature Focus:** The changes indicate a dedicated effort to implement and refine a "smart paste" functionality for bank details, including the input modal, processing, and subsequent feedback banners.
*   **State and Effect Management:** `useState` and `useRef` hooks are regularly employed for managing component state and side effects, with explicit cleanup functions in `useEffect` to prevent resource leaks (e.g., clearing timeouts).

## 12:17:24 PM
The provided log details changes across three files, primarily focusing on UI components related to a "Smart Paste" feature for bank details, and a general-purpose "Action Card" component. All changes occurred on **February 2, 2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 2:53:29 PM**
        *   Introduced the `SmartPasteModal` component, a `BottomSheetModal` designed to allow users to paste bank details from their clipboard.
        *   It features an input area for pasted text, a "Continue" button, and handles a "processing" state with an `ActivityIndicator`.
        *   Key functionalities include `handlePaste` (using `expo-clipboard` to get text and `expo-haptics` for feedback), `showProcessing` (which initiates a `PROCESSING_DELAY` before calling `handleContinue`), and `handleContinue` (which parses bank details using `parseBankDetails` and calls `onApply`).
        *   Error and warning logging are implemented using a `logger` utility, along with haptic feedback for success/failure.
        *   The UI includes detailed instructions and bullet points on what to include in the pasted text.
        *   Styling is managed with `react-native-unistyles` `StyleSheet`, and common UI components (`Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Pressable`, `BackButton`, `CloseIcon`) are imported from `@/components/ui`.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:35:51 PM**
        *   A minor but important refinement was made to the `handleClose` function.
        *   The update ensures that any pending `processingTimeoutRef` is `clearTimeout` and set to `null` upon modal closure. Additionally, the `pastedDetails` state is now explicitly reset to an empty string (`setPastedDetails('')`) when the modal closes, providing better state cleanup and preventing stale data on subsequent openings.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ui/ActionCard.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:38:17 PM**
        *   This entry introduces a versatile `ActionCard` component, designed for reusability across the application for various action items.
        *   It supports multiple `variant` types ('filled', 'transparent', 'inline') and allows for optional `icon`, `description`, `footer`, and a custom `titleElement`.
        *   The component intelligently renders as a `Pressable` if an `onPress` callback is provided, making it interactive, and as a simple `Box` otherwise for non-interactive display.
        *   The `showChevron` prop defaults to `true` when `onPress` is present, enhancing user understanding of interactable elements.
        *   It provides extensive customization for icon size and background color, and supports accessibility attributes (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`).

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteSection.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:39:45 PM**
        *   This component, `SmartPasteSection`, acts as an entry point or feedback mechanism for the smart paste feature.
        *   It conditionally renders either an "inline" `ActionCard` (aliased as `SmartPasteWidget`) which serves as the main entry point to open the `SmartPasteModal`, or an `InlineAlertBanner` (aliased as `SmartPasteBanner`).
        *   The banner can display either a success message (with `InfoSolidIcon`) or a failure message (with `WarningTriangleIcon`), based on `showAlertBanner` and `isSuccessBanner` props.
        *   The failure banner also includes an action button (`onPressAction`) to re-attempt the smart paste.
        *   This component effectively integrates the `ActionCard` from the UI library and provides a structured way to present the smart paste option and its outcomes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Component Structure:** Components are organized within `src/screens/.../components` for screen-specific logic and `src/components/ui` for reusable UI primitives.
*   **Styling System:** All components consistently utilize `react-native-unistyles` `StyleSheet` and `useTheme` for theme-based styling, promoting a unified look and feel.
*   **Custom UI Library:** There's heavy reliance on a custom UI component library (`@/components/ui`), which includes `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Pressable`, `BottomSheetModal`, `BackButton`, `CloseIcon`, `ChevronRightIcon`, and various icons.
*   **Internationalization:** The `useTranslation` hook (`t`) is frequently used across components for text content, indicating support for multiple languages.
*   **Hooks Usage:** React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useTheme`, and `useTranslation` are standard across these components.
*   **Accessibility:** `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, and `testID` props are widely implemented for improved usability and testing.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** `expo-haptics` is integrated into user interactions (e.g., pasting, clearing input) for tactile feedback.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** The `logger` utility is used for structured error and warning logging, enhancing debuggability.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps (within minutes of each other on the same day) suggest a focused development session or immediate follow-up improvements.

## 3:31:46 PM
The recent code changes primarily focus on enhancing the "Send Money" feature with a "Smart Paste" capability for bank details and introducing a new versatile UI component.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **2/2/2026, 2:53:29 PM**: An initial implementation or significant update of the `SmartPasteModal` component was made. This modal allows users to paste bank details from the clipboard, which are then parsed and applied to a form. It includes a user interface with guidance, a read-only input for pasted text, paste and clear buttons, a processing state with an activity indicator, and error handling. Haptic feedback and logging are integrated for user experience and debugging.
    *   **2/2/2026, 3:35:51 PM**: A refinement was made to the `handleClose` function within the `SmartPasteModal`. The update added logic to explicitly clear any pending `processingTimeoutRef` and reset the `pastedDetails` state (`setPastedDetails('')`) when the modal is closed. This ensures that any ongoing processing is safely terminated and the input field is cleared upon dismissal.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ui/ActionCard.tsx`**
    *   **2/2/2026, 3:38:17 PM**: A new highly reusable `ActionCard` UI component was introduced. This component is designed to display actionable items with a title, optional description, various visual `variant`s ('filled', 'transparent', 'inline'), custom icons (which can be displayed with or without a background container), a custom title element, a footer, and an optional chevron arrow. It supports interactive (with `onPress`) and non-interactive states, and includes comprehensive accessibility props and styling options.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteSection.tsx`**
    *   **2/2/2026, 3:39:45 PM**: This new component, `SmartPasteSection`, was added to integrate the smart paste functionality into the user interface. It intelligently renders either an `ActionCard` (aliased as `SmartPasteWidget` with an `inline` variant) as an entry point to open the smart paste modal, or an `InlineAlertBanner` (aliased as `SmartPasteBanner`) to display success or failure messages after bank details have been processed. This conditional rendering ensures appropriate user feedback and interaction flow based on the `showAlertBanner` and `isSuccessBanner` props.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Modular Component Design**: The project follows a clear separation of concerns, with reusable UI components (`ActionCard.tsx`) stored separately from feature-specific components (`SmartPasteModal.tsx`, `SmartPasteSection.tsx`).
*   **Theming and Internationalization**: All components consistently utilize `useTheme()` and `useTranslation()` hooks, indicating a robust system for theming and multi-language support.
*   **User Feedback**: `expo-haptics` is extensively used across interactive elements (paste, clear, continue) to provide tactile feedback, enhancing the user experience.
*   **Logging and Error Handling**: The `logger` utility from `@/utils` is used for recording errors and warnings, demonstrating a focus on application stability and debuggability.
*   **Consistent Styling**: `react-native-unistyles` is the preferred method for defining component styles, ensuring a unified styling approach across the application.
*   **Accessibility and Testability**: Components frequently include `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, and `testID` props, highlighting a commitment to accessibility and automated testing.
