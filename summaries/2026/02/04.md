# Activity Summary for 2/4/2026

## 12:30:33 AM
The changes log details updates across several UI components and a specific feature within a `nova-cp-app` project, all occurring on **February 2, 2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 2:53:29 PM:** This initial version introduces the `SmartPasteModal` component. It utilizes a `BottomSheetModal` to provide a guided experience for users to paste bank details. Key functionalities include:
        *   Pasting text from the clipboard using `expo-clipboard` with haptic feedback.
        *   Displaying a processing state with an `ActivityIndicator` after initiation.
        *   Parsing pasted details using a `parseBankDetails` utility.
        *   Handling success or failure of parsing with haptic notifications and logging.
        *   A `processingTimeoutRef` is used to manage a delay before attempting to parse details.
        *   The UI includes a disabled `TextInput` to show the pasted content, a "Paste" button, and a "Continue" button.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:35:51 PM:** A significant enhancement was made to the `handleClose` function. It now explicitly clears any pending `processingTimeoutRef` and resets the `pastedDetails` state. This ensures proper cleanup when the modal is dismissed, preventing potential memory leaks or unexpected behavior from delayed processing.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ui/ActionCard.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:38:17 PM:** This entry details the definition of a highly reusable `ActionCard` component. It's designed to provide consistent styling for interactive or informational list items. Key features include:
        *   Support for `title`, `description`, `icon`, and an optional `footer` (e.g., for badges).
        *   Multiple visual `variant` options: `filled`, `transparent`, and a new `inline` variant specifically for rendering a title and chevron in a compact row.
        *   Configurable `iconSize`, `iconBackgroundColor`, and an option to hide the icon container.
        *   A `titleElement` prop allows for custom JSX in the title area, enabling inline icons or other formatting.
        *   The `showChevron` prop can be explicitly set or defaults to `true` if an `onPress` handler is provided, making the card interactive.
        *   New `textDecorationLine` prop for title text styling, enabling underlining.
        *   It integrates accessibility props (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`) and supports a `disabled` state. The component intelligently renders as a `Pressable` when interactive, otherwise as a plain `Box`.

*   **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteSection.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 3:39:45 PM:** This file defines the `SmartPasteSection` component, which acts as a dynamic entry point and feedback mechanism for the smart paste feature. It conditionally renders:
        *   A `SmartPasteWidget` (an `ActionCard` of `inline` variant with an underline) if no alert banner is active, serving as the main button to open the `SmartPasteModal`.
        *   A `SmartPasteBanner` (an `InlineAlertBanner`) to display either success or failure messages after bank details parsing. The failure banner includes an action button to retry.
        *   It uses `InfoSolidIcon` for success and `WarningTriangleIcon` for failure states.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Development Date:** All reported changes occurred on the same day, `2/2/2026`, indicating a focused development effort.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The project heavily relies on a modular, component-based structure, using generic UI components (e.g., `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `ActionCard`) from a shared `components/ui` library.
*   **Theming and Localization:** The `useTheme` and `useTranslation` hooks are consistently applied across all components, highlighting a standardized approach to styling and supporting multiple languages.
*   **User Experience and Accessibility:** Emphasis on user feedback through `expo-haptics` (light, medium, error notifications) and extensive use of `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` props in interactive elements demonstrates a commitment to a good user experience and accessibility.
*   **Logging:** The `logger` utility from `@/utils` is used for debugging and error reporting in various scenarios.
*   **Smart Paste Feature Focus:** The changes indicate a dedicated effort to implement and refine a "smart paste" functionality for bank details, including the input modal, processing, and subsequent feedback banners.
*   **State and Effect Management:** `useState` and `useRef` hooks are regularly employed for managing component state and side effects, with explicit cleanup functions in `useEffect` to prevent resource leaks (e.g., clearing timeouts).
