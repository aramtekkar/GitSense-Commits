# Activity Summary for 2/13/2026

## 9:13:53 AM
The log details changes to a single file: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/components/ErrorScreens/ErrorScreenLayout.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates for `ErrorScreenLayout.tsx`:**

*   **Initial Refactoring (2/12/2026, 6:50:18 PM):** The hardcoded width value `345` used in the `title`, `description`, and `downtime` styles was extracted into a new constant, `CONTENT_WIDTH`, defined within the `StyleSheet.create` callback. This improved readability and maintainability by centralizing the width definition.
*   **Constant Scope Adjustment (2/12/2026, 6:50:42 PM):** The `CONTENT_WIDTH` constant was moved from its original position inside the `StyleSheet.create` callback to the top-level scope of the file, alongside `ICON_SIZE`. This makes `CONTENT_WIDTH` a global constant for the file, potentially allowing it to be used outside the stylesheet definition if needed.
*   **Temporary Style Modification (2/12/2026, 6:51:08 PM):** The `title` and `description` styles were updated to include `maxWidth: CONTENT_WIDTH`. This change aimed to ensure that these elements would not exceed the defined content width.
*   **Style Reversion (2/12/2026, 6:51:24 PM):** The `maxWidth: CONTENT_WIDTH` property that was just added to the `title` and `description` styles was subsequently removed. This suggests that the `width: CONTENT_WIDTH` property was considered sufficient, or the `maxWidth` addition caused unintended layout behaviors that led to its quick removal.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/12/2026, 6:50:18 PM:** Introduction of `CONTENT_WIDTH` constant.
*   **2/12/2026, 6:50:42 PM:** Relocation of `CONTENT_WIDTH` to file-level scope.
*   **2/12/2026, 6:51:08 PM:** Addition of `maxWidth` property.
*   **2/12/2026, 6:51:24 PM:** Removal of `maxWidth` property.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The changes demonstrate a clear pattern of refining the layout and styling of the `ErrorScreenLayout` component, specifically focusing on content width. The recurring element is the value `345`, which was initially hardcoded, then extracted into a constant `CONTENT_WIDTH`, and consistently applied across multiple style properties (`title`, `description`, `downtime`). There's also a pattern of iterative refinement, where a stylistic change (`maxWidth`) was introduced and then quickly reverted within a short timeframe, indicating testing and immediate adjustment.
