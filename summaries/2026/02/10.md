# Activity Summary for 2/10/2026

## 12:48:16 PM
The provided log details changes across two TypeScript React Native components within the `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/cards/components/` directory, all occurring on **February 9, 2026**.

### File: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/cards/components/CreditCard.tsx`

This file defines the `CreditCard` component, which displays either a physical or virtual card with an optional frozen overlay.

*   **Initial State (9:51:45 PM):** The component was introduced with basic styling for the frozen overlay text, including `marginTop` and `top` properties in `frozenTagText`. The `type` prop for `CreditCardProps` was defined using an imported `CardType`.
*   **Update (9:52:24 PM):** Styling for `frozenTagText` was adjusted; `fontWeight: '500'` was added, and `marginTop` was removed while `top` was retained.
*   **Significant Change (9:52:41 PM):** The type definition for the `type` prop in `CreditCardProps` was simplified from `CardType` (an imported type from `@/services/api`) to a generic `string`, reducing coupling to the API service module. Additionally, `marginTop` was re-added to `frozenTagText` and `top` was removed, further refining the text's vertical alignment.
*   **Minor Update (9:52:48 PM):** No functional code changes were observed in this entry; it appears to be a save operation or reformatting without substantive changes.

### File: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/cards/components/FreezeCardBottomSheet.tsx`

This file defines the `FreezeCardBottomSheet` component, a confirmation bottom sheet for freezing or unfreezing a card, complete with haptic feedback and dynamic content.

*   **Initial State (9:58:07 PM):** The component was established, featuring dynamic titles, descriptions, and button labels based on the `isFrozen` prop. It uses `BottomSheetModal` from `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` and `expo-haptics` for user feedback. Test IDs for confirmation buttons are dynamically set.
*   **Minor Update (9:58:35 PM):** No functional code changes were observed in this entry, similar to the `CreditCard.tsx` entry, indicating a non-substantive save or reformat.
*   **JSDoc Update (9:58:42 PM):** The JSDoc example for component usage was updated, introducing a typo `isLoading={is}`.
*   **JSDoc Correction (9:58:51 PM):** The typo in the JSDoc example was corrected from `isLoading={is}` to `isLoading={isLoading}`. No functional changes were made to the component itself.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Date:** All changes across both files occurred on **2/9/2026**, suggesting a focused development session on card-related features.
*   **Technology Stack:** Both components are written in TypeScript for React Native, utilizing `react-native-unistyles` for styling, and custom UI components from a local library (`@/components/ui`).
*   **Common Hooks:** Both `CreditCard` and `FreezeCardBottomSheet` leverage `useTheme` and `useTranslation` hooks, indicating a standardized approach to theming and internationalization across the application.
*   **Minor Refinements and Documentation:** A recurring pattern is the presence of minor stylistic adjustments (e.g., `fontWeight`, `marginTop` in `CreditCard.tsx`) and updates/corrections to JSDoc comments (e.g., `FreezeCardBottomSheet.tsx`), alongside commits that appear to be non-substantive saves or reformatting.
*   **Modularity:** The project structure places these components in a dedicated `cards/components` directory, suggesting a modular approach to feature development.
