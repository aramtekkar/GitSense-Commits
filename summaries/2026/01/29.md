# Activity Summary for 1/29/2026

## 12:25:53 PM
The provided logs indicate changes across two distinct files within the `nova-cp-app` project, primarily related to bank details management in a "send money" flow.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp (1/28/2026, 11:39:45 AM):** A minor cleanup occurred where a `logger.debug('SmartPasteModal: clipboard content pasted');` statement was removed from the `handlePaste` function.
    *   **Timestamp (1/29/2026, 10:49:10 AM):** This update introduced more substantial changes:
        *   The import for `expo-clipboard` was refined from a wildcard import (`* as Clipboard`) to a named import specifically for `getStringAsync` (`getStringAsync as getStringAsyncClipboard`), and the `handlePaste` function was updated to use this new import directly.
        *   A `logger.info('Bank details', { bankDetails });` statement was removed from the `handleContinue` function.
        *   The modal's main close button UI was significantly refactored. The original `Pressable` component with a `CloseIcon` was replaced by a `Box` containing a `BackButton` component. Correspondingly, the `closeButton` stylesheet definition was updated to apply specific styling for the `BackButton`, including `width`, `height`, `borderRadius`, `backgroundColor`, and new shadow/elevation properties (`elevation`, `shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`, `borderWidth`, `borderColor`).

2.  **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/useBankDetailsForm.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp (1/29/2026, 10:48:37 AM):** A very minor, non-functional comment change occurred, updating `// Get valid field names` to `// Get valid field names from current`.
    *   **Timestamp (1/29/2026, 10:50:47 AM):** The core logic for applying parsed bank details was refactored within the `applyParsedBankDetails` function.
        *   The `setFieldValue` mechanism, which previously used a type assertion to call `methods.setValue`, was changed. It now defines a new `setFieldValue` function that internally uses the `reset` method of `react-hook-form`. This `reset` call merges the updated field value with the current form values (`methods.getValues()`) and crucially uses options like `keepDirty: true`, `keepTouched: true`, `keepErrors: true`, and `keepValues: true` to ensure other form states are preserved.
        *   The `updateField` helper was adjusted to reflect this change, no longer passing `shouldTouch: true` directly, as this behavior is now handled by the `reset` method's `keepTouched` option. This indicates a more controlled and potentially more robust approach to programmatically updating form fields while maintaining their state.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Haptics Feedback Integration:** Both components consistently utilize `expo-haptics` for providing tactile feedback on user actions (e.g., `impactAsync` for button presses, `notificationAsync` for errors), indicating a focus on enhanced user experience.
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** The `logger` utility is extensively used across both files (`logger.debug`, `logger.info`, `logger.warn`, `logger.error`), demonstrating a strong emphasis on debugging, monitoring, and error tracking.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Both `SmartPasteModal.tsx` and `useBankDetailsForm.ts` leverage the `useTranslation()` hook to fetch localized strings, ensuring the application supports multiple languages.
*   **React Hook Form Usage:** The `useBankDetailsForm.ts` hook heavily relies on `react-hook-form` for managing complex form state, validation (with `zod/v4`), and submission logic, highlighting a standardized approach to form development.

## 1:25:56 PM
`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx` underwent several changes.
On 1/28/2026 at 11:39:23 AM, the initial version of the `SmartPasteModal` component was introduced. This component facilitates pasting bank details from the clipboard, parsing them using `parseBankDetails`, and applying them to a form. It includes UI for displaying instructions, a multi-line `TextInput` for the pasted content, and buttons for "Paste," "Clear," and "Continue." Haptic feedback and logging were integrated for user interactions and error handling.
A minor update occurred on 1/28/2026 at 11:39:45 AM, where a debug log statement (`logger.debug('SmartPasteModal: clipboard content pasted');`) was removed from the `handlePaste` function.
A more substantial update took place on 1/29/2026 at 10:49:10 AM. The clipboard import was refactored from a wildcard import (`import * as Clipboard`) to a named import (`import { getStringAsync as getStringAsyncClipboard } from 'expo-clipboard'`). Concurrently, the close button mechanism was changed: the original `Pressable` with a `CloseIcon` was replaced by a `BackButton` component (`<BackButton variant="close" ... />`), leading to a complete overhaul of the `closeButton`'s styling (adding shadows, elevation, and a border). Additionally, a `logger.info` call related to 'Bank details' was removed from the `handleContinue` function.

`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/useBankDetailsForm.ts` also saw significant development.
The initial implementation on 1/28/2026 at 11:44:41 AM introduced the `useBankDetailsForm` custom hook. This hook centralizes complex logic for managing a bank details form, including dynamic schema validation with Zod and `react-hook-form`, fetching payment country data, deriving currency and country, and handling form submission. It includes an `applyParsedBankDetails` callback to programmatically update form fields based on parsed data, setting `shouldDirty`, `shouldValidate`, and `shouldTouch` options. The `handleFormSubmit` function manages recipient creation via an API, displays toast messages, logs submission details, and navigates the user to different screens based on whether the transfer is USD or international.
On 1/29/2026 at 10:48:37 AM, a subtle change was made within the `applyParsedBankDetails` callback. The `shouldTouch: true` option was removed when calling `setFieldValue` for individual form fields.
A more significant refactoring occurred on 1/29/2026 at 10:50:47 AM within the `applyParsedBankDetails` callback. The internal `setFieldValue` helper function was altered to use `methods.reset` instead of `methods.setValue` to update specific fields. This new `reset` call now includes options to `keepDirty`, `keepTouched`, `keepErrors`, and `keepValues`, indicating an intent to better preserve the form's state when applying parsed data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Both files consistently utilize `expo-haptics` to provide tactile feedback for user actions, such as pasting content or continuing with a form.
*   **Logging:** The `logger` utility is extensively used across both the UI component and the custom hook for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and error reporting, indicating a robust logging strategy.
*   **Internationalization:** The `useTranslation` hook is present in both files, signifying that the application supports multiple languages and all user-facing text is managed through translation keys.
*   **`react-hook-form` and Zod:** The `useBankDetailsForm` hook is built heavily on `react-hook-form` for form management and Zod for schema validation, demonstrating a consistent approach to form handling.
*   **Modular UI Components:** Both files leverage shared UI components from `@/components/ui`, indicating a component-based architecture.
*   **Date-based Development:** The timestamps show continuous development activity across two consecutive days (January 28th and 29th, 2026), suggesting focused work on these features.

## 2:25:53 PM
The changes log details updates across two key files related to handling bank details for money transfers.

### File: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`

This file defines a React Native `BottomSheetModal` component named `SmartPasteModal`, designed to allow users to paste bank details, parse them, and apply them to a form.

*   **Initial state (1/28/2026, 11:39:23 AM):** The component was established with functionality for pasting text from the clipboard, parsing bank details using `parseBankDetails`, and handling application to a form or error notifications. It included a `TextInput` for paste, a conditional clear button, and a continue button. `logger.debug` was used to confirm clipboard content pasting.
*   **Minor adjustment (1/28/2026, 11:39:45 AM):** The `logger.debug('SmartPasteModal: clipboard content pasted');` statement was removed from the `handlePaste` function.
*   **Significant Refactor (1/29/2026, 10:49:10 AM):** This timestamp marks several important changes:
    *   **Clipboard Import:** The `expo-clipboard` library's `getStringAsync` function was directly imported as `getStringAsyncClipboard` instead of being dynamically imported within `handlePaste`.
    *   **UI Component Change:** The modal's close button was refactored from a generic `Pressable` with a `CloseIcon` to a dedicated `BackButton` component imported from `@/components/ui`.
    *   **Styling Update:** The `closeButton` style definition was significantly modified to include `elevation`, `shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`, `borderWidth`, and `borderColor`, reflecting the change to the `BackButton` component and enhancing its visual appearance.
    *   **Logging Removal:** The `logger.info('Bank details', { bankDetails });` statement was removed from the `handleContinue` function.

### File: `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/useBankDetailsForm.ts`

This file implements the `useBankDetailsForm` custom React hook, which encapsulates the complex logic for managing the bank details form. This includes dynamic schema validation, API interactions for beneficiaries and countries, currency/country derivation, and form submission.

*   **Initial state (1/28/2026, 11:44:41 AM):** The hook was introduced, providing methods for form management (`react-hook-form`), country and currency handling, and an `applyParsedBankDetails` function. The `applyParsedBankDetails` function used `methods.setValue` and explicitly set `shouldDirty`, `shouldValidate`, and `shouldTouch` options to `true` when updating fields.
*   **Minor adjustment (1/29/2026, 10:48:37 AM):** In the `applyParsedBankDetails` function, the `shouldTouch: true` option was removed from the `setFieldValue` call within the `updateField` helper.
*   **Significant Refactor (1/29/2026, 10:50:47 AM):** The implementation of `applyParsedBankDetails` was substantially revised:
    *   The internal `setFieldValue` constant within `applyParsedBankDetails` was changed to use the `reset` method of `react-hook-form`. This `reset` call now merges in existing form values (`...methods.getValues()`) and uses new options: `keepDirty: true, keepTouched: true, keepErrors: true, keepValues: true,` to preserve the form's state more comprehensively during updates.
    *   Consequently, the `updateField` helper's options for `setFieldValue` were simplified to only include `shouldDirty: true` and `shouldValidate: true`, as the `keepTouched` behavior is now handled by the outer `reset` call.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Haptics Integration:** Both files frequently use `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback (`impactAsync`, `notificationAsync`) on user interactions like pasting, continuing, and error alerts. This indicates a focus on enhancing user experience through physical feedback.
*   **Logging:** A `logger` utility is consistently employed across both components for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and error reporting, often providing structured context. This suggests a robust approach to monitoring and troubleshooting application behavior.
*   **Internationalization:** The `useTranslation` hook is a common dependency in both components, highlighting a design consideration for supporting multiple languages in the application's user interface.
*   **UI Component Library:** The `@/components/ui` alias is frequently used for importing common UI elements like `BottomSheetModal`, `Box`, `Button`, `Text`, `CloseIcon`, and `Pressable`, pointing to the use of a shared and standardized UI component library.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps for `SmartPasteModal.tsx` on 1/28/2026 (e.g., 11:39:23, 11:39:30, 11:39:37, 11:39:45, 11:39:51 AM) suggest a period of quick, iterative changes or minor adjustments being committed in close succession.
