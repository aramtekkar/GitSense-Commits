The file `/src/screens/send-money/EnterAmountP2P.screen.tsx`, last modified on January 19, 2026, at 4:20:59 PM, defines the `EnterAmountP2P` screen, which is a core component of the Nova-to-Nova peer-to-peer (P2P) payment flow.

This screen is responsible for allowing users to input an amount for a P2P transfer. Key aspects include:

*   **User Interface:** It features a centralized `CurrencyInput` for the transfer amount, a `NoteInput` for an optional message, and displays the user's current `BalanceDisplay`. An `AmountLimitMessage` informs the user about minimum and maximum transfer limits. Essential information like "Arrives Instantly" and "No fee" is highlighted, indicating the nature of P2P transfers.
*   **Validation and Feedback:** The screen performs real-time validation for insufficient balance, and whether the entered amount is below the minimum or above the maximum allowed. Haptic feedback is integrated for user interactions, such as pressing the "Continue" button.
*   **Keyboard Management:** It incorporates `KeyboardAvoidingView` to prevent the keyboard from obscuring content and provides an `AmountInputAccessory` that appears with the keyboard, offering quick buttons to increment, decrement, or dismiss the keyboard.
*   **Navigation:** Upon successful validation, the user can proceed to a review screen (`/send-money/review`) with all transfer details. An option to add funds (`/add-money/choose-add-money-method`) is also available if the balance is insufficient.
*   **Data Handling:** The screen utilizes several custom hooks, including `useBalance` to fetch the user's balance, `useExchangeRate` to determine transfer limits, `useAmountInput` for amount parsing and manipulation, and `useTransferValidation` to apply business logic rules.
*   **Localization and Accessibility:** It uses `useTranslation` for multilingual support and includes accessibility labels and hints for improved usability.
*   **Styling:** The component employs `react-native-unistyles` for consistent, theme-based styling throughout the UI.
