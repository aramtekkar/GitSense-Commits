# Activity Summary for 1/16/2026

## 11:04:08 AM
All changes are confined to the file `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/onboarding/Onboarding.constants.ts`.

The primary focus of the updates was the `ONBOARDING_SCREENS` array, specifically addressing the `titleKey` for the third screen object.

*   **1/15/2026, 5:40:41 PM:** The `titleKey` for the third onboarding screen was initially an empty string (`''`). The `AUTO_ADVANCE_DELAY` was set to `10000` (10 seconds).
*   **1/15/2026, 5:40:52 PM:** The `titleKey` for the third screen was updated from an empty string to `'test'`.
*   **1/15/2026, 5:41:00 PM:** The `titleKey` for the third screen was further refined from `'test'` to `'onboarding.screen3.title'`, aligning its naming convention with the other onboarding screens (`screen1`, `screen2`, `screen4`).

Throughout these changes, the `AUTO_ADVANCE_DELAY` constant remained unchanged at `10000`. The overall pattern indicates a process of refining and finalizing the localized title key for the third onboarding screen.
