# Activity Summary for 1/19/2026

## 6:10:54 PM
The log details an update to the `EnterAmountP2P.screen.tsx` file on January 19, 2026, at 4:20:59 PM.

**File: `/src/screens/send-money/EnterAmountP2P.screen.tsx`**
This file defines the `EnterAmountP2P` screen component, which is central to the Nova-to-Nova payment flow. It handles the user interface and logic for entering a payment amount and an optional note before proceeding to confirmation.

**Key updates and functionalities observed in this file include:**
*   **Core Purpose:** Facilitates Nova-to-Nova P2P payments, displaying "Arrives Instantly" and "No fee" information.
*   **Recipient Information:** Accepts `recipientId`, `recipientName`, and `recipientAccount` as props to identify the payee.
*   **State Management:** Manages the entered `sendAmount`, `note`, and input focus states.
*   **Hooks Integration:** Leverages a suite of custom hooks including `useTranslation`, `useCurrency`, `useKeyboard`, `useBalance`, `useExchangeRate`, `useAmountInput`, and `useTransferValidation` for internationalization, keyboard visibility, fetching user balance and exchange rates, parsing amount inputs, and validating transfer conditions.
*   **Amount Validation:** Implements checks for insufficient balance, minimum transfer limits, and maximum transfer limits, displaying appropriate messages to the user.
*   **User Interface:** Utilizes custom UI components such as `CurrencyInput`, `NoteInput`, `BalanceDisplay`, `AmountLimitMessage`, and `BottomActionButtons`. It also features an `AmountInputAccessory` for quick increment/decrement of the amount when the keyboard is active and the input is focused.
*   **Navigation:** `handleContinue` navigates to a `/send-money/review` screen, passing all necessary payment details. A separate `handleAddFunds` function allows users to navigate to the "add money" flow if their balance is insufficient.
*   **Haptic Feedback & Logging:** Integrates `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback on user interactions and uses a `logger` utility to record key events, such as when the continue button is pressed.
*   **Accessibility:** Includes `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` for critical input fields to enhance usability for assistive technologies.
*   **Styling:** Uses `react-native-unistyles` for consistent theming and styling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Component-based Architecture:** Heavy reliance on custom UI components and hooks (`@/components/ui`, `@/hooks`) indicates a modular and reusable component structure.
*   **Internationalization:** Consistent use of `useTranslation()` and `locale` for text and currency formatting suggests strong i18n support.
*   **User Feedback:** The integration of `expo-haptics` across different actions highlights a focus on providing immediate and intuitive user feedback.
*   **Data Fetching & Validation:** Repeated pattern of using custom hooks (`useBalance`, `useExchangeRate`, `useTransferValidation`) to fetch necessary data and perform real-time validation for user inputs.
