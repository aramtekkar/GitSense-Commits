# Activity Summary for 1/30/2026

## 3:04:23 AM
The file `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx` underwent several changes between January 28th and 29th, 2026. Initially, from 1/28/2026, 11:39:23 AM to 11:39:51 AM, the code remained largely consistent across saves, primarily focusing on a `SmartPasteModal` component. This component facilitates pasting bank details, using `expo-haptics` for user feedback, dynamically importing `expo-clipboard` to retrieve text, and `parseBankDetails` utility for processing the pasted content. It features a modal UI with a text input, paste button, and a continue button, along with extensive accessibility labels and error logging. A minor change occurred around 11:39:45 AM where a `logger.debug` statement was removed from the `handlePaste` function. The most significant update for this file happened on 1/29/2026, 10:49:10 AM:
*   The `expo-clipboard` import was refactored from a dynamic import (`await import('expo-clipboard')`) to a direct named import (`import { getStringAsync as getStringAsyncClipboard }`).
*   The modal's close mechanism was updated, replacing a `Pressable` with a `CloseIcon` with a `Box` containing a `BackButton` component. This change also involved a complete redesign of the `closeButton` style, moving from a subtle background to an elevated, shadowed, and bordered button, aligning with a more prominent UI component.
*   A `logger.info` call related to 'Bank details' was removed from the `handleContinue` function.

The file `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/useBankDetailsForm.ts` also saw multiple updates across January 28th and 29th, 2026. The versions recorded on 1/28/2026, 11:44:41 AM and 11:44:48 AM were identical, describing a custom React hook `useBankDetailsForm` that encapsulates bank details form logic. This hook uses `react-hook-form` with dynamic Zod schema validation, integrates with API services for creating beneficiaries and fetching payment countries, and manages form state, currency derivation, and submission. It includes an `applyParsedBankDetails` function designed to update form fields based on externally parsed bank details. On 1/29/2026, 10:48:37 AM, a minor adjustment was made within the `applyParsedBankDetails` function: the `options` passed to `methods.setValue` no longer included `shouldTouch: true`. A more substantial change occurred on 1/29/2026, 10:50:47 AM, where the field update logic within `applyParsedBankDetails` was refactored. Instead of directly using `methods.setValue`, a new `setFieldValue` wrapper function was introduced that calls `methods.reset` with `{ keepDirty: true, keepTouched: true, keepErrors: true, keepValues: true }` options, ensuring that updating individual fields preserves the overall form state more comprehensively.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Haptic Feedback:** `expo-haptics` is consistently used in both files to provide tactile feedback for user interactions (e.g., light impact for minor actions, medium for significant ones, error notification for failures).
*   **Robust Logging:** The application heavily relies on a `logger` utility for various levels of logging (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) across different stages of component lifecycle and function execution, aiding in debugging and operational insights.
*   **Internationalization:** The `useTranslation()` hook is uniformly applied for all user-facing text, ensuring multi-language support.
*   **Custom UI Components:** Both files utilize a set of consistent UI components from a local library (`@/components/ui`), indicating a shared design system.
*   **Error Handling:** Both components include comprehensive `try...catch` blocks for error management, coupled with logging and user notifications (haptic feedback, toasts).
*   **Timestamps:** All changes are clustered within a two-day period (January 28-29, 2026), suggesting a focused development effort or refactoring sprint.
