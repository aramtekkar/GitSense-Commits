# Activity Summary for 1/30/2026

## 3:04:23 AM
The file `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx` underwent several changes between January 28th and 29th, 2026. Initially, from 1/28/2026, 11:39:23 AM to 11:39:51 AM, the code remained largely consistent across saves, primarily focusing on a `SmartPasteModal` component. This component facilitates pasting bank details, using `expo-haptics` for user feedback, dynamically importing `expo-clipboard` to retrieve text, and `parseBankDetails` utility for processing the pasted content. It features a modal UI with a text input, paste button, and a continue button, along with extensive accessibility labels and error logging. A minor change occurred around 11:39:45 AM where a `logger.debug` statement was removed from the `handlePaste` function. The most significant update for this file happened on 1/29/2026, 10:49:10 AM:
*   The `expo-clipboard` import was refactored from a dynamic import (`await import('expo-clipboard')`) to a direct named import (`import { getStringAsync as getStringAsyncClipboard }`).
*   The modal's close mechanism was updated, replacing a `Pressable` with a `CloseIcon` with a `Box` containing a `BackButton` component. This change also involved a complete redesign of the `closeButton` style, moving from a subtle background to an elevated, shadowed, and bordered button, aligning with a more prominent UI component.
*   A `logger.info` call related to 'Bank details' was removed from the `handleContinue` function.

The file `/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/useBankDetailsForm.ts` also saw multiple updates across January 28th and 29th, 2026. The versions recorded on 1/28/2026, 11:44:41 AM and 11:44:48 AM were identical, describing a custom React hook `useBankDetailsForm` that encapsulates bank details form logic. This hook uses `react-hook-form` with dynamic Zod schema validation, integrates with API services for creating beneficiaries and fetching payment countries, and manages form state, currency derivation, and submission. It includes an `applyParsedBankDetails` function designed to update form fields based on externally parsed bank details. On 1/29/2026, 10:48:37 AM, a minor adjustment was made within the `applyParsedBankDetails` function: the `options` passed to `methods.setValue` no longer included `shouldTouch: true`. A more substantial change occurred on 1/29/2026, 10:50:47 AM, where the field update logic within `applyParsedBankDetails` was refactored. Instead of directly using `methods.setValue`, a new `setFieldValue` wrapper function was introduced that calls `methods.reset` with `{ keepDirty: true, keepTouched: true, keepErrors: true, keepValues: true }` options, ensuring that updating individual fields preserves the overall form state more comprehensively.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Haptic Feedback:** `expo-haptics` is consistently used in both files to provide tactile feedback for user interactions (e.g., light impact for minor actions, medium for significant ones, error notification for failures).
*   **Robust Logging:** The application heavily relies on a `logger` utility for various levels of logging (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) across different stages of component lifecycle and function execution, aiding in debugging and operational insights.
*   **Internationalization:** The `useTranslation()` hook is uniformly applied for all user-facing text, ensuring multi-language support.
*   **Custom UI Components:** Both files utilize a set of consistent UI components from a local library (`@/components/ui`), indicating a shared design system.
*   **Error Handling:** Both components include comprehensive `try...catch` blocks for error management, coupled with logging and user notifications (haptic feedback, toasts).
*   **Timestamps:** All changes are clustered within a two-day period (January 28-29, 2026), suggesting a focused development effort or refactoring sprint.

## 6:07:22 AM
The recent code changes primarily focus on refining the "Send Money" feature, specifically around the "Smart Paste" functionality for bank details and the underlying form logic. All modifications occurred on January 28th and 29th, 2026, indicating a focused period of development.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/28/2026, 11:39:45 AM**: A minor logging statement (`logger.debug('SmartPasteModal: clipboard content pasted');`) was removed from the `handlePaste` function, streamlining console output.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/29/2026, 10:49:10 AM**: This update introduced a significant UI and functional refactor.
        *   The `expo-clipboard` import changed from a dynamic `import('expo-clipboard')` to a direct static import `getStringAsync as getStringAsyncClipboard`, making the clipboard access more direct.
        *   The modal's close button UI was redesigned. The original `Pressable` with a `CloseIcon` was replaced by a `Box` containing a new `BackButton` component (imported from `@/components/ui`), which uses a `variant="close"`.
        *   The associated `closeButton` style definition was extensively modified, adding `elevation`, `shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`, `borderWidth`, and `borderColor` for an enhanced visual effect.
        *   Another `logger.info` statement related to "Bank details" was removed from the `handleContinue` function.

2.  **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/useBankDetailsForm.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/29/2026, 10:48:37 AM**: A subtle change was made in the `applyParsedBankDetails` callback. When setting field values, the `shouldTouch` option was removed from the `options` object passed to `methods.setValue`. Additionally, a comment was slightly rephrased for clarity.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/29/2026, 10:50:47 AM**: This update included a substantial change to how parsed bank details are applied to the form.
        *   The `setFieldValue` helper function within `applyParsedBankDetails` was refactored. Instead of directly calling `methods.setValue` for individual fields, it now uses the `reset` method of `react-hook-form`. This `reset` call merges current form values with the new field value and explicitly preserves `keepDirty`, `keepTouched`, `keepErrors`, and `keepValues` for a more controlled state update when applying parsed details.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Haptic Feedback:** Both components frequently use `expo-haptics` (`impactAsync` for interactions, `notificationAsync` for errors) to provide tactile feedback to the user, emphasizing a focus on enhanced user experience.
*   **Logging:** The `logger` utility is consistently used across both files for debugging, informational messages, and detailed error reporting (`logger.debug`, `logger.info`, `logger.warn`, `logger.error`), including handling of `ChimeraError` with specific error codes and validation details.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** The `useTranslation` hook (`t()`) is prevalent, indicating that all user-facing text is managed through a translation system.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust `try...catch` blocks are implemented for critical operations (clipboard access, bank detail parsing, API calls), with clear error logging and user notifications (e.g., `Toast.show` for success/failure).
*   **Component Reusability:** The use of a shared UI component library (`@/components/ui`) for elements like `BottomSheetModal`, `Button`, `CloseIcon`, `Pressable`, `Text`, and `BackButton` is a recurring pattern, promoting consistency and maintainability.
*   **React Hook-Based Architecture:** The extensive use of `useState`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` highlights a modern React development approach, leveraging hooks for state management, memoization, and side effects.
