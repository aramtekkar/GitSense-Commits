# Activity Summary for 1/28/2026

## 12:35:10 PM
The provided log details changes across two distinct files, both related to the "send-money" feature within the `nova-cp-app`. The timestamps indicate very close modifications on January 28, 2026.

**File-specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/SmartPasteModal.tsx`**
    *   **Functionality:** This file defines the `SmartPasteModal` component, which assists users in pasting bank details from their clipboard. It includes UI for displaying instructions, an input field for pasted text, and buttons for pasting, clearing, and continuing. It leverages `expo-clipboard` to access clipboard content and `parseBankDetails` utility to process the pasted text. Error handling and haptic feedback are integrated into the paste and continue actions.
    *   **Significant Change:** Between 1/28/2026, 11:39:37 AM and 1/28/2026, 11:39:45 AM, a debug logging statement (`logger.debug('SmartPasteModal: clipboard content pasted');`) was removed from the `handlePaste` asynchronous function. This suggests a minor cleanup or refinement of logging verbosity during the clipboard paste operation.
    *   **Consistency:** The overall structure, UI elements (BottomSheetModal, Box, Button, Text, TextInput, Pressable), and the logic for parsing bank details, handling user input, and managing modal state remained consistent across all recorded changes for this file.

2.  **`/Users/ashishramtekkar/Documents/Projs/nova-cp-app/src/screens/send-money/components/useBankDetailsForm.ts`**
    *   **Functionality:** This file exports the `useBankDetailsForm` custom React hook, which encapsulates the complex logic for a bank details form. It handles form initialization using `react-hook-form` with dynamic Zod schema validation, fetches payment countries via an API, derives effective currency and country, and manages form submission. The hook also includes logic for applying parsed bank details from a `SmartPasteModal` (though the modal itself isn't in this file) and navigating to different screens based on the transfer type (e.g., USD domestic vs. international via chat). Error handling for API calls, including specific validation errors, is also implemented.
    *   **Observed Changes:** The provided log entries for this file at 1/28/2026, 11:44:41 AM and 1/28/2026, 11:44:48 AM show identical content. Both snippets are truncated, ending with the comment `// Get valid field names`. Based on the available log, no functional or structural changes are visible within the provided portion of this file during these timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Haptic Feedback:** Both files extensively use `expo-haptics` (e.g., `Haptics.impactAsync`, `Haptics.notificationAsync`) for providing tactile feedback to users on various interactions like button presses, successful pastes, or errors. This indicates a focus on enhancing user experience through sensory cues.
*   **Logging:** The `logger` utility from `@/utils` is used consistently across both files for debugging, informational messages, and error reporting, often including contextual details (e.g., `screen`, `errorCode`, `correlationId`). This suggests robust logging practices for monitoring and troubleshooting.
*   **Internationalization:** Both components utilize the `useTranslation` hook, indicating that the application supports multiple languages and text content is managed via translation keys (e.g., `t('send.addBankDetails.smartPasteSheet.title')`).
*   **Component Structure:** The files demonstrate a clear separation of concerns, with `SmartPasteModal.tsx` focusing on the UI and direct user interaction for pasting, while `useBankDetailsForm.ts` handles the underlying form logic, data fetching, validation, and integration with backend services.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The timestamps, often mere seconds apart, suggest a period of active development, saving frequently, or minor adjustments being made in quick succession.
*   **Contextual Relevance:** Both files are deeply integrated into the "send-money" flow, specifically concerning the addition of bank details, highlighting a critical part of the application's functionality.
